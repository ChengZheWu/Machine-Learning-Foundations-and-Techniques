# The daily revenue of the hotel booking company prediction

# Introduction
In this final project, I am going to be part of an exciting machine learning competition. A hotel booking company tries to predict the daily revenue of the company from the data of reservation. In particular, after a room reservation request is fulfilled (i.e. no cancellation), on the arrival date, the revenue of the request is the rate of the room (called ADR) multiplied by the number of days that the customer is going to stay in the room, and the daily revenue is the sum of all those fulfilled requests on the same day. The goal of the prediction is to accurately infer the future daily revenue of the company, where the daily revenue is quantized to 10 scales.

# Data Sets
The data sets are processed from the [Kaggle hotel booking demand data](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)
